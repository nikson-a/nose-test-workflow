Overview
The GitHub Test Action is an automated workflow that runs tests on your code every time a pull request is created. This ensures that changes to the code do not break existing functionality. Pytest is a testing framework for Python that makes it easy to write and run tests for your Python code.

Prerequisites
Before you set up the test action, you need to have the following:

A GitHub repository for your Python application
A Python application with test files using Pytest
Set Up the Test Action
To set up the test action for your Python application, follow these steps:

Create a .github/workflows directory in the root of your repository.

Create a new YAML file in the .github/workflows directory. You can name the file whatever you like, but it must have a .yml extension. For example, test.yml.

Add the following code to the YAML file:

yml
Copy code
name: Test

on: [pull_request]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Set up Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v2
        with:
          python-version: 3.x  # Replace with the version of Python you are using
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: pip install -r requirements.txt  # Replace with the name of your requirements file
      - name: Run tests
        run: pytest tests  # Replace with the name of your test directory
Commit and push the changes to your repository.

Run the Test Action
The test action will run automatically every time a pull request is created. You can also run the test action manually by following these steps:

Go to the Actions tab in your repository.

Click on the test workflow to view the details.

Click on the "Run workflow" button to run the test action.

Conclusion
The GitHub Test Action using Pytest is a powerful tool for ensuring the quality and reliability of your Python application. By following the steps outlined in this readme file, you can easily set up and run tests for your Python code in GitHub.
